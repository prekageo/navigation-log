Oftentimes, we try to remember how we ended up on a website. Unfortunately, the browser history is not enough to get this information.

This add-on for Firefox logs all navigation actions to an SQLite database. The source URL is logged together with the destination URL and title every time you click a link or type in the address bar.

So, it is possible to recreate your whole browsing history.

In order to use it, please:
1) install the add-on from here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/navigation-log/, then
2) download the external tool that manages the SQLite database from here: https://github.com/prekageo/navigation-log, and
3) execute `python navigation_log.py --install`.
